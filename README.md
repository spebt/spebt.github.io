# SPEBT Project Documentation

## Documentation Generation

This website is generated by Sphinx with \"PyData Sphinx Theme\"
required Python packages:

``` zsh
sphinx
pydata-sphinx-theme
sphinx_design
myst_parser
```

### Develop the site locally

> [!TIP]
> For easy management of the *Python* packages, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. 
> I recommand using `conda` and *Miniconda* should be sufficient for this purpose. 
> Check out the [Miniconda
documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) for more
information.

1.  Install the required Python packages:

    ``` shell
    pip install sphinx pydata-sphinx-theme sphinx_design myst_parser
    ```

2.  Clone or download the website code from GitHub:

    <https://github.com/spebt/spebt.github.io>

3.  Change the contents as is needed with your favorite editor.
> [!TIP]
> Popular editors:
> -   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
> -   [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

1.  Run the following command to build the website:

    ``` shell
    make html
    ```

2.  Open the generated HTML `index.html` in the `build` directory with
    your browser (e.g. *google chrome*).

### Deploy to GitHub page

-   Use `git` to commit your tested changes and push to the remote
    repository.
-   GitHub Actions will take over the rest.
