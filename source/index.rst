SPEBT documentation
===================
The SPEBT project aims at the design, evaluation and optimization of new Single Photon Emission Tomography System. 
- The analytical modelling and Monte Carlo simulation rely heavily on the use of the `High Performace Computer (HPC) compute cluster <https://docs.ccr.buffalo.edu/en/latest/hpc/clusters/#ub-hpc-compute-cluster>`_ at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo.
