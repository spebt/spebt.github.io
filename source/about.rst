Documentation Generation
========================

This website is generated by Sphinx with "PyData Sphinx Theme"
required Python packages:

.. code-block:: zsh

    sphinx
    pydata-sphinx-theme
    sphinx_design
    myst_parser

Develop the site locally
------------------------
.. tip::

   * For easy management of the *Python* packages, it is recommended to use a virtual environment. 
   * I recommand using ``conda`` and *Miniconda* should be sufficient for this purpose.
   * Check out the `Miniconda documentation <https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/>`_ for more information. 

#. Install the required Python packages:

   .. code-block:: shell

      pip install sphinx pydata-sphinx-theme sphinx_design myst_parser

#. Clone or download the website code from GitHub:
 
   https://github.com/spebt/spebt.github.io

#. Change the contents as is needed with your favorite editor.

    Popular editors:

    * `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_
    * `Neovim <https://neovim.io/>`_

   
#. Run the following command to build the website:

   .. code-block:: shell

      make html

#. Open the generated HTML ``index.html`` in the ``build`` directory with your browser (e.g. *google chrome*).

Deploy to GitHub page
---------------------

* Use ``git`` to commit your tested changes and push to the remote repository. 
* GitHub Actions will take over the rest.
